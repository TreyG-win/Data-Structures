# Data-Structures
These are a few of the projects that I was happy with and felt that I learned a lot from. This course features
a heavy amount of Java 1.8 for these assignments.

* Project 8_33JG is an interesting program that allows the user to discover all of the anagrams
  inside of a file. I have included some test files to use if the user does not want to make their own.

* Project 13 is a project that uses JavaFX to create a menu system that can allow someone to create
  a list of students with some credit hours and a degree of choice.
  
* Project 19.26JG demonstrates the basic process of a binary search tree by allowing the user to
  enter their own numbers on the terminal.
  
* Project 20.18JG is based around creating a list of random numbers with an integer hash table.
