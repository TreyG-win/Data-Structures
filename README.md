# Data-Structures
These are a few of the projects that I was happy with and felt that I learned a lot from. This course features
a heavy amount of Java 1.8 for these assignments.

* Project 13 is a project that uses JavaFX to create a menu system that can allow someone to create
  a list of students with some credit hours and a degree of choice.
  
* Project 19.26JG demonstrates the basic process of a binary search tree by allowing the user to
  enter their own numbers on the terminal.
  
* Project 20.18JG is based around creating a list of random numbers with an integer hash table.
